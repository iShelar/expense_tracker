# Contributing Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration. All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct. Thank you for being kind to each other!

## Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search [issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new! This helps avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes any kind of contribution! Here are a few suggestions:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Code**: help maintain and improve the project codebase.


### Let's Contribute :+1:

- **Step 1** - Fork this repository.
- **Step 2** - Clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Step 3** - Locally set-up the project using the following steps.

    First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

    [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

    The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
- **Step 4** - Resolve the bugs, mentions provided in the Issues section of the repository. _Also add a description of what changes you have done_.
- **Step 5** - Add the changes to your repository.
- **Step 6** - Create a PULL Request. And that's all.
- **Step 7** - Your PR will be reviewed and merged accordingly, if no changes are required. For any queries or suggestions, contact [@supminn](https://twitter.com/supminn) on Direct Message.
